# General Notes

## Plan

As of 2015-07-25, in Bilbao.

- [ ] Use the annotations in the syntax highlighting
- [ ] Clean up the left merge business
- [ ] Get something that dumps the (matching_glob, hash) information from Python
- [ ] Get something that dumps the AST from Python
- [ ] Look into glomming together data from more than one file
  - [ ] Probably a graph database, do some R&D
- [ ] Identify where a definition actually is
- [ ] When you click on a link, go to the definition
- [ ] Get information from "real" data
  - [ ] Files on disk
  - [ ] From Github repos

### Notes

* Maybe want to have separate project for storing stuff in a graph database
* Use nix to provide accurate dependency information
