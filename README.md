# Code search

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jml/holborn.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jml/holborn)

Current project goal is to be able to browse a Git repository of code, being
able to click on elements of the code and jump to their definitions, or to
where they are used.

Our intent is that this repository will contain multiple Haskell packages. The
main one is `holborn-web`.
