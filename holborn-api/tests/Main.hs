-- TODO: Become very clever and figure out how to share a resource between
-- Tasty resources and Hspec tests. Would shave off ~3s from test runs on
-- jml's laptop.

-- TODO: Update the main app to only connect when we try to talk to the
-- database. Ideally, it should use a connection pool. See newPool and
-- withPoolConnection at
