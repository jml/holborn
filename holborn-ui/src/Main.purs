-- | This task list application is made up of two Thermite components:
-- |
-- | - a component for a single task (Components.Task)
-- | - a component for a list of tasks (Components.TaskList)
-- |
-- | This example demonstrates the main features of a Thermite app:
-- |
-- | - Using `simpleSpec` to create simple components from `Render` and
-- |   `PerformAction` functions
-- | - Composing components using the `Monoid` instance and lens combinators.
-- |
-- | For each component we start by declaring action and state types.
