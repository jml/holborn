{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}

{-| Simple model for lexical scopes.

Intended to work for any programming language, but currently only has Python
use case.

Languages provide their own AST objects and implement 'Interpreter' for them.
The 'interpret' function then specifies how to traverse the AST. The major
operations are:

 * 'bind'
 * 'addReference'
 * 'pushScope'
 * 'popScope'

'calculateAnnotations' then takes an interpreter and produces a map of code
locations to 'Annotation' values.

== Missing

Currently missing support for a few necessary features

 * re-binding a variable within a scope
 * unbinding a variable
 * declaring different models for variables within a scope (e.g. Python's
   @global@).
 * support for unresolved references

-- a namespace, and that a reference is a "read". Interpreting expressions
-- should be a read-only operation.

-- Natural way to build the model is to have a stack of environments, and
-- every time we come across a binding to insert that into the model, and also
-- to note every time we come across a reference.
--
-- We want to then be able to do a second pass that just looks at the tokens
-- and then consults this 'database' to see whether it is a definition or a
-- reference or nothing
--
-- Therefore, the database needs to be indexed by something that we have when
-- we have the tokens:
--   probably source location
--
-- Therefore, when we insert the definitions or references, we need to make
-- note of their source location
--
-- There will be some things which are ambiguous references, most notably,
-- references to attributes on objects. We can think of those references as
-- partial functions that can only be resolved when given other information.
