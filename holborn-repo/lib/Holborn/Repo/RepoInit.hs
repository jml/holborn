-- | Initialize a bare repository on disk. The contract is that by the
-- time a push arrives at our doorstep either API or the SSH
-- terminator have vetted that the push is valid. See note [1] at end
-- of this file for why we're not locking.
--
-- Lazy initializion happens in two contexts:
-- 1/ user pushes to a new repository
-- 2/ user does an implicit fork (communicated by API or the SSH header)
--
-- We care about the difference because a lazy init for an implicit
-- fork can be made much more efficient by cloning the other repo
-- first.
